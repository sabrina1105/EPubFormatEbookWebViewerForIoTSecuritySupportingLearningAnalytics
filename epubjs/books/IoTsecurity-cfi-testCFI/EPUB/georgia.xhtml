          <p id="d10e64">Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter operate within the existing Internet infrastructure.</p>
          <p id="d10e65">IoT security is the area of endeavor concerned with safeguarding connected devices and networks in the Internet of things (IoT).</p>
          <img src="images/IoT.png" id="imgIoT" alt="IoTSecurity"/>
          <p id="d10e66">The Internet of Things involves the increasing prevalence of objects and entities known, in this context as things provided with unique identifiers and the ability to automatically transfer data over a network.</p>
          <p id="d10e67">Much of the increase in IoT communication comes from computing devices and embedded sensor systems used<span id="page1" epub:type="pagebreak">1</span> in industrial machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, smart energy grids, home and building automation, vehicle to vehicle communication and wearable computing devices.</p>
          <p id="d10e68">The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances</p>
          <p id="d10e69">The main problem is that because the idea of networking appliances and other objects is relatively new, security has not always been considered in product design.</p>
          <p id="d10e70">IoT products are often sold with old and unpatched embedded operating systems and software. </p>
          <p id="d10e71">Furthermore, purchasers often fail to change the default passwords on smart devices -- or if they do change them, fail to select sufficiently strong passwords.</p>
          <p id="d10e72">To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet, should be segmented into its own network and have network access restricted.</p>

          <p id="d10e105">Unauthorized access is when someone gains access to a website, program, server, service, or other system using someone else's account or other methods. For example, if someone kept guessing a password or username for an account that was not theirs until they gained access it is considered unauthorized access.</p>
          <p id="d10e106">HackerUnauthorized access could also occur if a user attempts to access an area of a system they should not be accessing.</p>
          <p id="d10e107">When attempting to access that area, they would be denied access and possibly see an unauthorized access message.</p>
          <p id="d10e108">Some system administrators set up alerts to let them know when there is an unauthorized access attempt, so that they may investigate the reason.</p>
          <p id="d10e109">These alerts can help stop hackers from gaining access to a secure or confidential system. Many secure systems may also lock an account that has had too many failed login attempts.</p>

          <p id="d10e122">In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance.Vulnerabilities are the intersection of three elements: a system susceptibility or flaw, attacker access to the flaw, and attacker capability to exploit the flaw. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerability is also known as the attack surface.</p>
          <p id="d10e123">Vulnerability management is the cyclical practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities. This practice generally refers to software vulnerabilities in computing systems.</p>
          <p id="d10e124">A security risk may be classified as a vulnerability. The use of vulnerability with the same meaning of risk can lead to confusion. The risk is tied to the potential of a significant<span id="page3" epub:type="pagebreak">3</span> loss. Then there are vulnerabilities without risk, for example when the affected asset has no value. A vulnerability with one or more known instances of working and fully implemented attacks is classified as an exploitable vulnerability—a vulnerability for which an exploit exists. The window of vulnerability is the time from when the security hole was introduced or manifested in deployed software, to when access was removed, a security fix was available deployed, or the attacker was disabled—see zero-day attack.</p>
          <p id="d10e125">Security bug (security defect) is a narrower concept, there are vulnerabilities that are not related to software, hardware, site, personnel vulnerabilities are examples of vulnerabilities that are not software security bugs. Constructs in programming languages that are difficult to use properly can be a large source of vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p id="d10e129">User authentication</p>
          <p id="d10e130">User authentication is a process that allows a device to verify the identification of someone who connects to a network resource. There are many technologies currently available to a network administrator to authenticate users. Firewall operates with frequently used applications, including RADIUS, Windows Active Directory, LDAP, and token-based Secure ID. The Firebox also has its own authentication server. You can use the Firebox authentication features to monitor and control connections through the Firebox.</p>
          <p id="d10e131">Authentication is very important when you use dynamic IP addressing (DHCP) for computers on the trusted or optional network. It is also important if you must identify your users before you let them connect to resources on the external network. Because the Firebox associates a user name to an IP address, we do not recommend that you use authentication features in a network with multi-user computers such as Unix servers, terminal servers or Citrix servers. The Firebox authenticates one user per computer.</p>


          <p id="d10e133">Firewall function</p>
          <p id="d10e134">In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the Internet.</p>
          <p id="d10e135">Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or host-based firewalls. Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks and run on network hardware. Host-based firewalls run on host computers and control network traffic in and out of those machines.</p>
